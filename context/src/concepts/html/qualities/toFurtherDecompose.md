# Noting that the goal is to individualize concepts
The issue with this current concept is that it still is part of "User Interface."
But to truly have this be compositional, we would have to have each html append to their own data field.
And then within a unifying user interface concept, move that html field into the "Working Composition".

Therefore this is a work in progress. As the final workflow would be able to unify the quality itself into "User Interface" and edit the functionality of the quality itself to suite "User Interface." Perhaps the better approach here would be to isolate each html method into a function that User Interface Calls. As we are attempting to avoid excess steps, as each step is increasing the complexity of each strategy.

As this is also leaving room for the possibility of creating a User Interface that does not use Html. As currently the web interface we all use is a construct itself.
